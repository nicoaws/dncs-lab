# Requirements
 - Python 3
 - 10GB disk storage
 - 2GB free RAM
 - Virtualbox
 - Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
 - Internet

# How-to
 - Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
 - Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/dustnic/dncs-lab`
 - You should be able to launch the lab from within the cloned repo folder.
```
cd dncs-lab
[~/dncs-lab] vagrant up
```
Once you launch the vagrant script, it may take a while for the entire topology to become available.
 - Verify the status of the 4 VMs
 ```
 [dncs-lab]$ vagrant status                                                                                                                                                                
Current machine states:

router                    running (virtualbox)
switch                    running (virtualbox)
host-a                    running (virtualbox)
host-b                    running (virtualbox)
```
- Once all the VMs are running verify you can log into all of them:
`vagrant ssh router`
`vagrant ssh switch`
`vagrant ssh host-a`
`vagrant ssh host-b`
`vagrant ssh host-c`

# Assignment
This section describes the assignment, its requirements and the tasks the student has to complete.
The assignment consists in a simple piece of design work that students have to carry out to satisfy the requirements described below.
The assignment deliverable consists of a Github repository containing:
- the code necessary for the infrastructure to be replicated and instantiated
- an updated README.md file where design decisions and experimental results are illustrated
- an updated answers.yml file containing the details of 

## Design Requirements
- Hosts 1-a and 1-b are in two subnets (*Hosts-A* and *Hosts-B*) that must be able to scale up to respectively 384 and 198 usable addresses
- Host 2-c is in a subnet (*Hub*) that needs to accommodate up to 483 usable addresses
- Host 2-c must run a docker image (dustnic82/nginx-test) which implements a web-server that must be reachable from Host-1-a and Host-1-b
- No dynamic routing can be used
- Routes must be as generic as possible
- The lab setup must be portable and executed just by launching the `vagrant up` command

## Tasks
- Fork the Github repository: https://github.com/dustnic/dncs-lab
- Clone the repository
- Run the initiator script (dncs-init). The script generates a custom `answers.yml` file and updates the Readme.md file with specific details automatically generated by the script itself.
  This can be done just once in case the work is being carried out by a group of (<=2) engineers, using the name of the 'squad lead'. 
- Implement the design by integrating the necessary commands into the VM startup scripts (create more if necessary)
- Modify the Vagrantfile (if necessary)
- Document the design by expanding this readme file
- Fill the `answers.yml` file where required (make sure that is committed and pushed to your repository)
- Commit the changes and push to your own repository
- Notify the examiner that work is complete specifying the Github repository, First Name, Last Name and Matriculation number. This needs to happen at least 7 days prior an exam registration date.

# Design
Decided to give Subnet Host-a the subnet mask 255.255.254.0 because it must be able to scale up to 384 host, so we must choose ...
